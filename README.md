This repository contains an exploration of the [2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays) dataset from Kaggle. 

The dataset is composed of three files: __airlines.csv__, __airports.csv__ and __flights.csv__. To run the notebook, you will need to download these files and place them in the `data` directory.
